# Quick start

It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

## Preview your site

Run the local server with `docsify serve`. You can preview your site in your browser on `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
docsify serve docs
```
